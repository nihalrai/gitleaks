# GitLeaks

## Info

Gitleaks will allow to do keyword search in github code and extract sensitive data from public git repository.

> Sensitive Data:

- Subdomains
- Credentials
- AWS Keys
- Email IDs


## TODO

- Get code data without authentication
  - Search for repo instead of code
  - Create a temprory user(can use protonmail which does need any personal data to create.)
  - Dig deeper in commits, issues and forked pull requests.
